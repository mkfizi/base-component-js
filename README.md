Insert below script inside `<head>` tag with `src` attribute's value referencing

## Usage

This library serves as a starting point for creating custom interactive
components. It does not come with a set of complete pre-built components and
requires custom activity implementations instead.

Simply put, this library is a scaffolding and only provides the groundwork on
initializing and handling components activities. You will need to write your
own codes for component's activities when the control event is triggered.

* [Alert](https://mkfizi.github.io/base-component/docs/alert)

### Accessibility

This library relies heavily on `aria-*` attributes for the component to work as
intended. Therefore, it already covers web accessibility practices on affected
component elements.
