# Base Component Js Examples

This is usage example for [Base Component Js](https://mkfizi.github.io/base-component-js).

## Modifying Source Code

To modify and execute source code, use NPM CLI command below to install Base Component JS dependancies.
```bash
npm install
```

Use one of built-in script CLI commands below to compile and build Javascript and CSS files using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).
```bash
npm run build
# Compile without minify.

npm run build:dev
# Compile for development environment.

npm run build:prod
# Compile for production environment.

npm run watch
# Compile without minify and watch for changes.

npm run watch:dev
# Compile for development environment and watch for changes.

npm run watch:prod
# Compile for production environment and watch for changes.
```

If you never heard of NPM before, this is the best time to start using it since
modern web development work best with NPM. Refer here for more informations:
